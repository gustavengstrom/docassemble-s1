    AR 98. When compiling the information required under paragraph 97 (a) for the gap in pay between its female and male employees (also known as the “gender pay gap”) the undertaking shall use the following methodology&#58;
    (a)
    include all employees’ gross hourly pay level; and
    (b)
    apply the following formula to calculate the gender pay gap&#58;
    (𝐴𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑙𝑦 pay level 𝑜𝑓 𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒 𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑦𝑒𝑒𝑠 − 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠

When disclosing the information required under paragraph 97 (a), the undertaking shall provide any contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been compiled (methodology). Information regarding how objective factors such as type of work and country of employment influence the gender pay gap may be reported.
    AR 100.The measure of the undertaking’s gender pay gap shall be reported for the current reporting period and, if reported in previous sustainability reports, for the previous two reporting periods.

  heading: <BR><h6>Explanation</h6>
  content: |
    AR 101.When compiling the information required by paragraph 97 (b), the undertaking shall&#58;
    (a)
    include all employees;
    (b)
    consider, depending on the undertaking’s remuneration policies, all of the following&#58;
    i.
    base salary, which is the sum of guaranteed, short-term, and non-variable cash compensation;
    ii.
    benefits in cash, which is the sum of the base salary and cash allowances, bonuses, commissions, cash profit-sharing, and other forms of variable cash payments;
    iii.
    benefits in kind, such as cars, private health insurance, life insurance, wellness programs; and
    iv.
    direct remuneration, which is the sum of benefits in cash, benefits in kind and total fair value of all annual long-term incentives (for example, stock option awards, restricted stock shares or units, performance stock shares or units, phantom stock shares, stock appreciation rights, and long-term cash awards).
    (c)

    AR 99. When disclosing the information required under paragraph 97 (a), the undertaking shall provide any contextual information necessary to understand the data and how the data has been compiled (methodology). Information regarding how objective factors such as type of work and country of employment influence the gender pay gap may be reported. AR 102.To illustrate the contextual information, the undertaking may provide an explanation to understand the data and how the data has been compiled (methodology). Quantitative data, such as the annual total remuneration ratio, may not be sufficient on its own to understand pay disparity and its drivers. For example, pay ratios can be influenced by the size of the undertaking (for example, revenue, number of employees), its sector, its employment strategy (for example, reliance on outsourced workers or part-time employees, a high degree of automation), or currency volatility.
