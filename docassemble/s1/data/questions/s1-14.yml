    AR 82. Fatalities may be reported separately for those resulting from work-related injuries and those resulting from work-related ill health. AR 89. In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking shall divide the respective number of cases by the number of total hours worked by people in its own workforce and multiplied by 1,000,000.

For comparability purposes a rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked shall be used also for undertakings with less than 500 people in the workforce.
