question: |
  Are all people in the undertaking&#x27;s own workforce who could be materially impacted by the undertaking included in the scope of its disclosure under ESRS 2? These material impacts shall include impacts that are connected with the undertaking’s own operations and its value chain, including through its products or services, as well as through its business relationships. 
help:
  label: Help?
  heading: <BR><h6>Explanation</h6>
  content: |
    ‘Own workforce’ includes workers who are in an employment relationship with the undertaking (‘employees’) and non-employee workers who are either individual contractors supplying labour to the undertaking (‘self-employed workers’) or workers provided by undertakings primarily engaged in ‘employment activities’. (NACE Code N78) AR 6.
    Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce can originate in its strategy or business model in a number of different ways. For example, impacts may relate to the undertaking’s value proposition (such as providing lowest cost products or services, or high-speed delivery, in ways that put pressure on labour rights in its own operations), or its cost structure and the revenue model (such as shifting inventory risk to suppliers, with knock-on effects on the labour rights of people who work for them).
    AR 7.
    Impacts on the undertaking’s own workforce that originate in the strategy or business model can also bring material risks to the undertaking. For example, risks arise if some people in the workforce are at risk of forced labour, and the undertaking is importing products into countries where the law allows for the confiscation of imported goods that are suspected of being made with forced labour. An example of opportunities for the undertaking may result from providing opportunities for the workforce such as job creation and upskilling in the context of a “just transition”. Another example, in the context of a pandemic or other severe health crisis, relates to the undertaking potentially relying on contingent labour with little to no access to sick care and health benefits that may face severe operational and business continuity risks as workers have no choice but to keep working while sick, further exacerbating the spread of the disease and causing major supply chain breakdowns. Reputational and business opportunity risks linked to the exploitation of lowskilled, low-paid workers in sourcing geographies with minimal protections for them are also increasing with media backlash and consumer preferences moving to more ethically sourced or sustainable goods.

    AR 8.
    Examples of particular characteristics of people in the undertaking’s own workforce that may be considered by the undertaking when responding to paragraph 15 relate to young people that may be more susceptible to impacts on their physical and mental development,
    or women in a context where women are routinely discriminated against in the terms and conditions of work, or migrants in a context where the market for the supply of labour is poorly regulated and workers are routinely charged recruitment fees. For some people in the
    workforce, the inherent nature of the activity that they are required to undertake may put them at risk (for example, people required to handle chemicals or operate certain equipment or low paid employees who are on “zero hours” contracts).

  Does any of its material risks and opportunities arising from impacts and dependencies on people in its own workforce relate to specific groups of people rather than to all of its own workforce? 
help:
  label: Help?
  heading: <BR><h6>Explanation</h6>
  content: |
    For example, a general pay cut, or training offered to all people in its own workforce. Groups of people are for example, particular age groups, or people working in a particular factory or country. AR 9. With regard to paragraph 16, material risks could also arise because of the undertaking’s dependency on its own workforce where low-likelihood but high-impact events may trigger financial effects; for example, where a global pandemic leads to severe health impacts on the undertaking’s workforce resulting in major disruptions to production and distribution. Other examples of risk related to the undertaking’s dependency on its workforce include a shortage in skilled workers or political decisions or legislation affecting its own operations and own workforce.
