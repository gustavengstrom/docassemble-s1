    (b)
    paternity leave&#58; leave from work for fathers or, where and in so far as recognised by national law, for equivalent second parents, on the occasion of the birth or adoption of a child for the purposes of providing care;
    (c)
    parental leave&#58; leave from work for parents on the grounds of the birth or adoption of a child to take care of that child, as defined by each Member State;
    (d)
    carers’ leave from work&#58; leave for workers to provide personal care or support to a relative, or a person who lives in the same household, in need of significant care or support for a serious medical reason, as defined by each Member State.
