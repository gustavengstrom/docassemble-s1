    AR 82. Fatalities may be reported separately for those resulting from work-related injuries and those resulting from work-related ill health. AR 89. In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking shall divide the respective number of cases by the number of total hours worked by people in its own workforce and multiplied by 1,000,000. Thereby, these rates represent the number of respective cases per one million hours AR 82. Fatalities may be reported separately for those resulting from work-related injuries and those resulting from work-related ill health.worked. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full time people in the workforce over a 1-year timeframe. For comparability purposes a rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked shall be used also for undertakings with less than 500 people in the workforce.
    AR 90. If the undertaking cannot directly calculate the number of hours worked, it may estimate this on the basis of normal or standard hours of work, taking into account entitlements to periods of paid leave of absence from work (for example, paid vacations, paid sick leave, public holidays) and explain this in its disclosures.
