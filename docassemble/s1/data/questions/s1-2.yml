  label: Help?
  heading: <BR><h6>Explanation</h6>
  content: |
    AR 21. To illustrate how the perspectives of its own workforce have informed specific decisions or activities, the undertaking may provide examples from the current reporting period. AR 23. Where possible, the undertaking may disclose examples from the reporting period to illustrate how the perspectives of its own workforce and workers&#x27; representatives have informed specific decisions or activities of the undertaking.
    AR 24. The undertaking shall consider the following aspects when fulfilling this Disclosure Requirement&#58;
    (a)
    The type of engagement (for example, information, consultation or participation) and its frequency (for example, ongoing, quarterly, annually);
    (b)
    how feedback is recorded and integrated into decision-making, and how people in the workforce are informed about the way in which their feedback has influenced decisions;
    (c)
    whether engagement activities take place at the organisational level or at a lower level, such as at the site or project level, and in the latter case, how information from engagement activities is centralised;
    (d)
    the resources (for example, financial or human resources) allocated to engagement; and
    (e)
    how it engages with people in its workforce and workers’ representatives on the impacts on its own workforce that may arise from reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to greener and climate-neutral operations, in particular restructuring, employment loss or creation, training and up/reskilling, gender and social equity, and health and safety.
